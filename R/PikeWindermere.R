#' @description Stock and recruitment data for Northern Pike (\emph{Esox lucius}) from Lake Windermere.
#' 
#' @name PikeWindermere
#' 
#' @docType data
#' 
#' @format A data frame of 75 observations on the following two variables:
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{year}{Year.} 
#'    \item{stock}{Female biomass (kg).}
#'    \item{recruits}{Number at age-2.} 
#'    \item{basin}{Basin of Windermere (North or South).} 
#'    \item{tdd14}{Temperature degree-days over 14C.} 
#'  }
#'  
#' @note Stock values were originally reported in 1000s of kgs and recruits were originally recorded in tens of numbers.  Thus, plots look very discrete.
